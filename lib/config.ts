  title: "VOLTA X The Institute of Art and Olfaction: MILK",
  description: `The Institute of Art and Olfaction presents Volta's “MILK.” Drawing in part from the Greek tragedy “Medea,” the work mixes dance, prose, sound, and scent to examine the construction of feminine desire and destruction. Writer Alexis Okeowo will orate an original epic narrative while the dancers tell the story through movement. Audience members will be able to sample custom blends developed by the Institute of Art and Olfaction that tell "MILK's" story through scent. `,
